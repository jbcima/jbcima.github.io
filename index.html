      Simply put, there is no socialist movement without a strong labor movement rooted in the power of rank-and-file workers. Without a strong base in the workers’ movement, there is little that distinguishes DSA or any other socialist group from the wide array of single-issue activist groups and foundation-funded nonprofit organizations. It is the key to building an independent base of social power that can effectively fight employers in the workplace; support the creation of a new socialist political formation; and hold our politicians accountable to our goals once they are elected to office. It would also be the most effective way to diversify our membership base along the lines of class, gender, race, ethnicity, and national origin. Unions, for all their problems, are among the most integrated institutions because they have to organize whomever the boss hires in order to be effective. The working class is the most diverse part of our society – if we want to change the demographic composition of DSA, this is where we must go.

      If elected to the NPC, we will work to develop a national program that encourages DSA locals around the country to adopt and implement the rank-and-file strategy. This will entail intensive political education in the thinking behind the strategy; an analysis of the most strategic sectors and occupations for DSA members to enter; and the creation of a support network for DSA members who choose to do this work. Our view is that this program should focus on three main strategic “industries”: education, health care, and logistics/distribution. These fields are critical nodes in today’s economy; offer opportunities to both rebuild existing unions and organize the unorganized; and give rank-and-file socialist organizers the chance to build power while living a decent life.
